        <h1>Aperture</h1>
        <h2>Aperture is an important aspect of photography</h2>

          In optics, an aperture is a hole or an opening through which light travels. More specifically, the aperture and focal length of an optical system determine the cone angle of a bundle of rays that come to a focus in the image plane. An optical system typically has many openings or structures that limit the ray bundles.

          <p>With the correct knowledge on aperture and how it can be used, a photographer can greatly enhance their skills.<p/>
